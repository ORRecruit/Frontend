            Why is Data Streaming Important?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Data streaming allows data processing in real-time, allowing
            organizations to make fast data-driven and actionable decisions.
            This helps companies make predictions and take proactive measures to
            prevent issues before they occur.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Data streaming has a lot of beneficial use cases. These include:
          </p>

          <ul className="space-y-1 list-disc list-inside">
            <li className="pl-5 relative py-2">
              Fraud detection: A bank or an e-commerce application needs to
              capture fraud and block a fraudulent transaction the moment it
              happens. It is quite irrelevant for a system to detect a
              fraudulent transaction three days after it happens.With data
              streaming, fraudulent or suspicious transactions are either
              blocked or flagged the moment they occur.
            </li>
            <li className="pl-5 relative py-2">
              Healthcare: With data streaming, you can monitor your patients in
              real time and also alert staff to any changes in their condition.
              Also, wearing devices such as smart watches can monitor your vital
              organs in real time and alert you if there is any change in
              condition.
            </li>
            <li className="pl-5 relative py-2">
              Logistics: With data streaming, users can monitor their goods and
              shipments in real time. This can also drive them to make informed
              decisions about the best routes to take, inventory management, and
              so on.This can help forecast accurate estimated time of arrival of
              goods and boost customer satisfaction.
            </li>
            <li className="pl-5 relative py-2">
              From these examples, you can see that the importance of data
              streaming in the modern era cannot be overemphasized. Data
              streaming is important in the health industry, finance industry,
              electronics industry, retail, construction, and logistics
              industry, amongst others.
            </li>
            <li className="pl-5 relative py-2">
              Since data streaming is paramount for organizations, it is very
              important for data engineers to make use of data streaming tools
              that ensure low latency and high throughput. In this article, you
              will learn how to stream data from Postgres to Snowflake using
              Estuary Flow.

                In today's competitive business landscape, finding and hiring
                top talent is more challenging than ever. Companies face

                agencies to streamline their hiring processes and find
                cost-effective solutions. In this blog post, we'll explore the

                With the demand for skilled workers on the rise, companies are
                under increasing pressure to attract and retain top talent.
                However, the traditional hiring process can be time-consuming,
                resource-intensive, and costly. Recruitment agencies offer a
                solution to these challenges by providing access to a vast
                network of qualified candidates, expertise in sourcing and
                screening candidates, and streamlined recruitment processes.

                  They use advanced screening techniques, such as behavioral
